This project demonstrates how to use an LSTM model for time series forecasting:

Synthetic Data: Generated a sine wave to simulate a continuous time series dataset.
Preprocessing: Normalized the data and prepared sequences using a sliding window method.
Model: Built an LSTM network with a single hidden layer.
Evaluation: Compared the model's predictions with the actual values.
Save Model: Saved the trained model for future use.
